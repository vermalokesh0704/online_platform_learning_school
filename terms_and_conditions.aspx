                        You understand and agree that submitting your ailments to Cellsalts4health.com does not in any way create or establish a Doctor-client relationship between you and any Doctor Member, or between you and Cellsalts4health.com. The information and answers provided in response to ‘cell salt finder’ is intended to be generic legal information, not legal advice, and is based upon the very limited information provided you in ‘cell salt finder’. Specific legal advice can only be given with full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances of your situation. If you are represented by a Doctor, that Doctor is the best person to give you advice about a case or legal matter. Under no circumstances should the information obtained on this site be used to make decisions about the quality of representation by a Doctor or about the proper course of a legal matter.

                    <p class="mb-20">
                        If you have any apprehension or concern about entering into the Representation Agreement or Advice Agreement, you should not book a Paid Consultation.

                    <h4 class="theme-color">Limited Doctor – Client Relationship:</h4>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        Users who book a Paid Consultation will enter into a Limited Doctor-Client Representation Agreement (the "Representation Agreement") with the responding Doctor.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        This Representation Agreement establishes Doctor-client relationship between the User and the Doctor that is limited in both scope and duration. The scope of the Doctor-client relationship under the Representation Agreement extends only to addressing the issue for which the particular Paid Consultation is booked, relieving the Doctor of any duty to further investigate, follow-up, take any other action, or represent the User in any further way. The answer by the Doctor shall be query centric based on limited knowledge of facts provided by you in your question. The duration of the Doctor-client relationship under the Representation Agreement is also limited, and the representation ends as soon as the Doctor provides the consultation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        You must understand that there are, of course, some issues that are too complicated for a Doctor to address appropriately and completely through a limited-scope representation of the type provided by Cellsalts4health.com for Paid Consultations. If Doctor determines, in the Doctor’s sole discretion, that a Paid Consultation simply cannot be addressed in the context of a limited scope representation, then you will be notified and your full amount paid for that consultation will be refunded.
